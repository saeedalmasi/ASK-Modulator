# ASK-Modulator
ASK  Modulator construction with vivado &amp; vivado hls

1-write the code to crate the sin wave in vivado hls and craite it as an ip core.
2-write the hdl code for custom input bit to change the amplitude of the sin wave.
3-Add both of that as an ip core and RTL block to block design and make the connection.
4-Run the simulation aftr the synthesized the code and craite wrpper.
